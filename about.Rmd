### A Catholic wedding?

A Catholic wedding is about an hour and a half long, and includes a mass with Holy Communion.

Communion?

As Catholics, we fully participate in the celebration of the Eucharist when we receive Holy Communion. If you are Catholic, we encourage you to come recieve Communion with us. In order to be properly disposed to receive Communion, participants should not be conscious of grave sin and normally should have fasted for one hour. A frequent reception of the Sacrament of Penance is encouraged for all who are receiving Communion.

We of course welcome all, and are delighted you have come to celebrate with us. However, because Catholics believe that the celebration of the Holy Eucharist is the Body and Blood of Christ, members of those churches with whom we are not yet fully united are ordinarily not admitted to Holy Communion.

For those not recieving Holy Communion, you may remain in your seat during Holy Communion, or come forward with your arms crossed over your chest to receive a blessing.
